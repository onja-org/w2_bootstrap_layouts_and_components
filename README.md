## üéØ Learning Objectives

By completing this lab, you will:
- Understand how to include Bootstrap in a project
- Master Bootstrap's grid system for responsive layouts
- Implement common Bootstrap components (navbar, cards, forms, buttons, alerts)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS
- Node.js installed on your machine
- A text editor or IDE

### Setup
1. Clone or download this repository
    ```bash
    git clone ...
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory
    ```bash
    cd w2_bootstrap_layouts_and_components
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run serve
   ```
5. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

npm run test:watch
```

## üìö Understanding Bootstrap Integration

Before diving into exercises, let's understand how Bootstrap is included in this project:

### CDN Method (Current Setup)
In `index.html`, Bootstrap is loaded via CDN:
```html
<!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.7/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">

<!-- Bootstrap JavaScript -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.7/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
```

**Pros:** Quick setup, always up-to-date, cached by browsers
**Cons:** Requires internet connection, less control over customization

### Alternative: Local Installation
You could also install Bootstrap locally:
```bash
npm install bootstrap
```
Then link to local files. We're using CDN for simplicity in this lab.

## üé® The Community Connection Hub Theme

Our project theme focuses on:
- **Community Building:** Bringing people together
- **Kindness & Support:** Promoting positive interactions
- **Inclusivity:** Welcoming everyone
- **Growth & Learning:** Encouraging personal and collective development

Keep this theme in mind as you write content for each exercise!

Run `npm test` frequently to ensure you're on track!

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
