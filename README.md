# Bootstrap Layouts and Components Lab üèóÔ∏è

Welcome to the Community Connection Hub! In this hands-on lab, you'll learn Bootstrap 5 by rebuilding an unstyled website step-by-step with Bootstrap.

## üë¢ What is Bootstrap?

Bootstrap provides ready-made CSS classes which help you create a consistent user interface across different devices and screen sizes without having to write custom CSS.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

We are going to take a basic HTML webpage and transform it into a fully responsive, mobile-first web application using Bootstrap. You will learn how to use Bootstrap's grid system, components, and utilities to create a visually appealing and functional layout.

By completing this lab, you will:
- Understand how to include Bootstrap in a project
- Master Bootstrap's grid system for responsive layouts
- Implement common Bootstrap components (navbar, cards, forms, buttons, alerts)
- Create a mobile-first, responsive web application
- Practice semantic HTML structure with Bootstrap classes
- Learn to recognize and apply Bootstrap class patterns

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS
- Node.js installed on your machine
- A text editor or IDE

### Setup
1. Clone or download this repository
    ```bash
    git clone [TODO: REPLACE WITH ACTUAL REPOSITORY URL ONCE IT IS HOSTED IN THE ONJA ORGANIZATION]
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory
    ```bash
    cd w2_bootstrap_layouts_and_components
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run serve
    ```
5. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

You now have the basic website up and running. Check out the website in your browser -- it is pretty boring at the moment! We will see it transform as you complete the exercises.

### Running Tests
To check your progress and ensure you're completing exercises correctly:
```bash
npm test
```

For continuous testing while you work:
```bash
npm run test:watch
```



## üìö Understanding Bootstrap Integration

Including Bootstrap in your project is easy!
Bootstrap is included by adding a `link` and a `script` tag so that the library is downloaded and included in your website. Look at the `<head>` section of `index.html`:

```html
<!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.7/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">

<!-- Bootstrap JavaScript -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.7/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
```

This has already been done in this project -- Bootstrap classes and components are ready to use in your HTML!

This direct linking method is quick and easy for learning. In real projects, you might want to install Bootstrap using other methods, but you don't need to worry about that at the moment.

## üß© How This Lab Works

As you progress through the exercises, you'll notice three types of learning:

1. **üéØ Guided Code**: Read through the provided Bootstrap code snippets in the comments for each exercise, and then copy it to replace the plain HTML
2. **üîç Fill-in-the-Blanks**: Strategic gaps in the provided code marked with `****` for you to figure out
3. **üí° Pattern Recognition**: Using Bootstrap class patterns you've already learned

> Make sure that you are reading through the code in the `index.html` exercise comments as you are completing the exercises. Reading through the Bootstrap HTML is how you will learn the patterns and how to use the classes. Just pasting it without reading it will not help you learn!

> Each exercise in the readme contains information about the Bootstrap classes being used. These classes are the foundation of styling with Bootstrap, and it is the purpose of this lab to familiarize you with them.

### Bootstrap Classes Cheat Sheet

## üìù Exercises

### Exercise 1: Navigation Bar üß≠

**Goal:** Create a responsive navigation bar using Bootstrap's navbar component.

**What you're building:** A dark navigation bar with the brand "Community Hub" on the left and navigation links on the right. On mobile devices, the links will collapse into a hamburger menu.

**Bootstrap Concepts Introduced In This Exercise**:
- [Navbar](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/navbar/): Bootstrap's navigation bar component. It is the container which holds the brand, navigation links, and other elements which generally appears at the top of the page. Items such as the navbar-brand (which is used to display the brand/logo), and navbar-nav (which is used to display the navigation links) go inside of the navbar component. The navbar can be made to collapse into a hamburger menu by adding the `navbar-expand-lg` class, which requires the use of the `Collapse` component, explained below.
- [Collapse](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/collapse/): Bootstrap's Collapse component is used to show and hide any content. Here, we will use it to collapse the navigation links into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.
- [Container](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/containers/): Bootstrap's container component is used to wrap content and provide padding.

**Step-by-step instructions:**

1. **Find the Exercise 1 comment** in `index.html` (around line 17)

2. **Replace the TODO comment** with provided navbar structure.

3. **üîç Fill in the blanks:**
- **Hint 1:** `nav-****` - What class marks a navigation item? (Think "nav-____")

4. **Test your work:** Run `npm test` - the first 5 tests should now pass! Try opening the developer tools (press F12) and using the "Responsive Design Mode" (ctrl+shift+m when the developer tools are open) to test your navbar's responsiveness. Shrink the size of the screen and watch the hamburger menu appear.

**Bootstrap classes explained:**
- `.navbar` - Base navbar component
- `.navbar-expand-lg` - Navbar expands to full width on large screens and up
- `.navbar-dark bg-dark` - Dark color scheme
- `.container` - Centers content with responsive padding
- `.navbar-brand` - Styles the brand/logo
- `.navbar-toggler` - Mobile hamburger button
- `.navbar-collapse` - Container for collapsible content
- `.navbar-nav` - Navigation list container
- `.nav-item` - Individual navigation item
- `.nav-link` - Navigation link styling
- `.ms-auto` - Pushes navigation to the right (margin-start: auto)

### Exercise 2: Hero Section üåü

**Goal:** Update the existing hero section (a hero section is a big section at the top of the page which serves as an introduction to the website) to be more visually appealing using Bootstrap classes.

**What you're building:** A large, centered hero section with a big heading, descriptive text, and call-to-action buttons.

**Bootstrap Concepts Introduced In This Exercise**:
- [Grid](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/grid/): In this exercise, we only use the grid system (including rows and columns) to help us style the hero section width. We are not actually using its full power yet! In the next exercise we will learn more about the grid system and how to use it to create more complex layouts.
- [Bootstrap Utilities](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/utilities/): Bootstrap provides convenient classes to add margin and padding such as `.mb-4`, which stands for "margin-bottom 4", and `py-5`, which stands for "padding in the y dimension 5". It also has useful utilities for applying classes only on certain screen sizes: when we add a breakpoint class like `.flex-sm-row`, this means that on small screens the flex direction will be vertical, but on larger screens this class will be ignored.
- [Button](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/buttons/): Bootstrap's button class can be used on `<button>` elements or on `<a>` elements as we are doing in this exercise.

**Step-by-step instructions:**

1. **Find the existing hero section**

2. **Replace the entire hero section** with the code provided in the comment.

3. **üîç Fill in the blanks:**
- **Hint 1:** `justify-content-****` - What class centers flex items? (It is used earlier in the hero section on the row)

3. **Test your work:** Run `npm test` - Make sure the Hero Section tests are passing. Notice how if you make the screen smaller, the buttons will stack vertically.

**Bootstrap classes explained:**
- `.bg-primary` - Blue background color
- `.text-white` - White text color
- `.py-5` - Large padding top and bottom
- `.display-4` - Large display heading
- `.fw-bold` - Bold font weight
- `.mb-4` - Margin bottom (spacing)
- `.lead` - Larger, emphasized text
- `.row` - Row container for column items
- `.col-lg-8` - 8 columns wide on large screens
- `.text-center` - Center-aligned text
- `.d-flex` - Display as flexbox

**üîç Discovery Challenge:** In this exercise, you'll fill in some blanks based on patterns you learned in Exercise 2!

**Bootstrap Concepts Introduced In This Exercise**:
- [Grid](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/grid/): Bootstrap's grid system is a responsive layout system built with flexbox. The grid does not have to be explicitly defined, you can just create a container and add rows and columns as needed.
- [Rows](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/rows/): A horizontal group of columns that make up a Bootstrap grid. You can think of this as a horizontal flexbox container, with each column being a flex item (and this is how it actually works behind the scenes). Rows are created by adding the `.row` class to an element.
- [Columns](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/columns/): Bootstrap's columns are the building blocks of the grid system. They are used to create horizontal groups of content. Columns are created by adding the `.col` class to an element.

**Step-by-step instructions:**

1. **Find the Exercise 3 comment**

2. **Replace the existing content** with this grid structure included in the comment.

3. **üîç Fill in the blanks:**

### Exercise 7: Alerts and Messages üí¨

> Alerts require some JavaScript to allow the user to get rid of them. You'll notice in the original HTML that the buttons have an `onclick` attribute which has some JavaScript code. Don't worry about the JavaScript part for now, just focus on the HTML structure and the CSS classes. In the Bootstrap version, you'll notice that we don't have to have an onclick attribute. The JavaScript to handle the alerts is already included in the Bootstrap library, all we have to do is add the `data-bs-dismiss="alert"` button to the correct HTML elements!

**Goal:** Add Bootstrap alerts to provide user feedback and information.
